# ScrumDeviations (Um estudo sobre desvios do framework de desenvolvimento de software Scrum)

 Esse projeto tem como objetivo em um estudo de caso analisar os desvios cometidos em uma equipe de desenvolvimento que utiliza o framework Scrum, classificando-os com suas respectivas áreas do Scrum, trazendo as consequências que os mesmos podem acarretar, e trazer sugestões para a equipe e para a comunidade em geral. Para alcançar esse objetivo, será realizada uma pesquisa com desenvolvedores e envolvidos no desenvolvimento de software em uma equipe específica situada no Vale dos Sinos, no Rio Grande do Sul, que utilizam Scrum, assim alertando equipes que pretendem adotar e que já adotaram o framework Scrum sobre consequências de escolhas em relação a aplicação do framework.
